Let's paint a "perfect" regulatory R organization. How would you like to see it work?

- How is analysis shared? _Files_, _images_, _packages_?
- How do you ensure quality, do new workflow opportunities open up?
- What about integrated solutions (Shiny, cross-language solutions?)
- How are internal tools layered on open-source tools? How are they
  reproducibly shared with health authorities?
- How does hiring/recruitment change when workflow is more public?
