### How did we get here?

* [Our whitepaper is widely adopted]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* [But implementing it is inconsistent & laborious]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}   
  * [Variations throughout industry are a risk]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Sharing software with health authorities is a challenge to any internal solution]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Health authorities, overwhelmed by technical inconsistencies, are more likely to question software use]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem

* R has this wonderful thing called CRAN, setting the standard of quality
  - Packages are constantly tested together
  - R has a culture of amazing documentation
  - Statisticians flock to R, and are constantly vetting its implementations

* R has this thorn in its side called CRAN, 
  - Builds are difficult to reproduce (key for validation)
  - Quality indicators are lacking
  - Difficult to roll back to an older snapshot (although tools exist to help with this.)
  - Governance is prone to bouts of hostility

### What does a solution look like?

We can model the successes of CRAN, while improving on its weaknesses
