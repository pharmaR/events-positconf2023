## Change of Leadership

- You may have noticed that I am not Andy Nicholls. 
- Last year, Andy decided to step down to focus on his growing responsibilities
  as Head of Data Science at GSK

## Pulse Check

- We looked back on how we had been working
- Identified new opportunities
  1. Refining holistic strategic direction
  1. Be mindful about communication and organization

* Taking ample time to engage stakeholders
  * Validation leads across the industry
  * Active health authority involvement
  * Analytic environment admins and developers
* Considering the possibilities
  * Mapping needs to solutions that meet the industry where it is
  * ...while building the path for it to move forward

* We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem

## Old dog, new trick

::: {.inremental}
* Modern package ecosystems are the stats world's _new trick_
* Methods are provided directly by statisticians and academics, rarely by vendors.
* Risk is managed not by itemized requirements, but by good development practices.[^1]
* We need to learn how to manage risk in a constantly evolving ecosystem

::: {.notes}
- **evolving**: 
  - Patches constantly fixing edge cases. Neglect to update is a risk.
  - Health authorities use latest CRAN. Differences
    in their system and yours introduces risk of inconsistency in results.

## What does a solution look like?

::: {.callout-note}
## If it's not broke, don't fix it!
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
- R has this wonderful thing called CRAN, setting the standard of quality
  - Packages are constantly tested together
  - R has a culture of amazing documentation
  - Statisticians flock to R, and are constantly vetting its implementations
:::


## What does a solution look like?

::: {.callout-warning}
## Fool me twice, shame on me
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
- R has this thorn in its side called CRAN, 
  - Builds are difficult to reproduce (key for validation)
  - Quality indicators are lacking
  - Difficult to roll back to an older snapshot (although tools exist to help with this.)
  - Governance isn't always the most friendly

## What does a solution look like?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Closing the CRAN gap for the Pharma Use Case
:::

- Reproducibility guidelines
- Standard, public assessment of packages
- Avenues for communicating about implementations, bugs, security
